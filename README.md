# Fathomless Gears

An in-development Foundry system for Fathomless Gears

Meant for use with Gearwright

NO MIGRATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE - don't rely on Foundry to keep actor data between updates to the package!

## Installation Instructions
In your `FoundryVTT/Data/Systems` folder, create a `hooklineandmecha` folder and put the contents of this repository inside.
In the `hooklineandmecha/data` folder, paste the `fish.json` file (available from the Discord server).

The folder structure should look like:

```
FoundryVTT
└── Data
    └── systems
        └── hooklineandmecha
            ├── assets
